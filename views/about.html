            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <p>Tweety made his first appearance in 1942 in "A Tale of Two Kitties", directed by Bob Clampett, but was not paired with Sylvester The Cat until five years later. The 1947 cartoon "Tweetie Pie" pitted them against each other for the first time. The cartoon, which won an Academy Award, was the start of many short cartoons to come.</p>

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>Tweety's design was originally based on a baby picture of Bob Clampett. In "A Tale of Two Kitties", Tweety's speech is strange, as he mispronounces many words, such as "pussy cat" (which he says as "puddy tat"). Tweety's name was originally Orson, but this was soon changed, as his current name was already presented in his second cartoon, "Birdy and the Beast" (1944). Tweety had initially been portrayed simply as a (wild) birdling whose species had not yet been specified and was shown to reside in an outdoor nest high in a tree. After those several portrayals, it was only till 1947 when he had his first domestic role and his first human interaction in "Tweetie Pie", of which would become the most noted portrayal of the character (However even then, he would still be shown residing in an outdoor nest in later shorts).</p>

            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>He is a yellow canary that has a somewhat large head. His temper was at first short and was often angry. His catchphrase is "I think I saw a kitten." As his character progressed, he became very calmer. Tweety appears to be an innocent little bird, sweet and extremely gentle character. Tweety often coming to handle Hector the Bulldog or hide behind Granny to avoid the cat, but in the end, he always manages to humiliate Sylvester, unless he ends up humiliating himself trying to catch Tweety, which in turn does nothing. Tweety, Sylvester, and Hector (sometimes) lives in a birdcage located in Granny's house. Granny is overprotective of Tweety and keeps Sylvester away from her prized bird.</p>

            <h2>Rivalry</h2>
            <p>Tweety and Sylvester are always after each other, much like Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner and the formerly-MGM owned, now-owned Warner Bros. cat and mouse duo Tom and Jerry. Sylvester is constantly trying to eat Tweety, and the yellow canary, in turn, is usually avoiding him with ease. Although Sylvester has laid hands on Tweety and got Tweety in his mouth on some occasions, most of the time he has never succeeded in eating the canary.  In Greedy for Tweety, Sylvester succeeded in eating Tweety in a hospital where Sylvester, Tweety, and Hector were hospitalized and Granny was their nurse and once Granny found out that Sylvester ate Tweety, she did an x-ray on Sylvester and cut him open and got Tweety out.  Most of the time, when Tweety is under the care of Granny, Sylvester cannot successfully outwit his opponent. Deep down Sylvester is jealous of Tweety because Granny gives him more attention.</p>
